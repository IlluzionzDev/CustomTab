  # If using an online_list across multiple columns, this option
  # should be set to false so it doesn't try to change pages
  enabled: true
  # Maximum amount of pages to create. If
  # items try to create more than this amount of

# The title of this tab column
title:
  # The custom skin for this tab element. There are multiple ways they're
  # defined. You can set the 'name' element here which will take
  # a skin from the skins.yml file. Otherwise you can directly specify the
  # 'value' and 'signature' like in skins.yml but right here under 'skin:'

  # These are the different animation frames for
  # this text. Each text element is iterated through
  # to create a dynamic animation. Colors are supported here
  # along with 1.16+ HEX codes. Hex codes can be used with

# What the list consists of. Here put

# Types: online_players
type: online_players

# In what order to display elements
# Put a custom sorter
# Sorters: distance, number_variable, weight
#
# distance: The closest players to you are near the top
# number_variable: A higher number appears higher
#                  Taken from 'sort-variable'
# weight: Uses weight taken from the player group
#         See 'groups.yml'. Higher weight appears at the top
sorter: weight

# This will be used for number_variable
# to sort by number. Can use placeholders
# so the value of the placeholder is used
